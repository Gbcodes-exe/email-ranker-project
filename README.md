# Email Ranking Engine: BM25 + Semantic Search

This project simulates an email inbox and ranks emails based on a user query using a hybrid approach: combining BM25 keyword relevance and semantic similarity from sentence embeddings.

Built using Python, this project showcases practical applications of NLP in intelligent search and information retrieval systems.

---

## Features

- Generates a mock inbox with 100 realistic emails
- Combines BM25 scoring with semantic similarity using Sentence Transformers
- Normalizes scores and ranks emails based on user queries
- Prints top-N most relevant emails for any given search term

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- rank_bm25
- sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
